### Here's What I've Learned Running a Business on Free Software

Most business software is designed for enterprises with hundreds of employees and unlimited budgets. But if you're running a small business, freelancing, or just want better control over your digital life, you're paying for features you'll never use.

**The reality:** Every subscription dollar you save can go toward growing your business, rewarding the team that got you here, or finally taking that vacation you promised your family.

**I run my entire consulting practice on free, open-source software** - same professional results, zero subscription fees, complete data control. Whether you're a business owner, student paying too much for software you barely use, or someone who values digital privacy, this approach works.

**Your current hardware is probably fine.** You don't need new computers - you need software that runs efficiently on what you already have.

### Time is Running Out for Windows 10

Microsoft ends Windows 10 support on **October 14, 2025** - forcing millions to buy new computers or [upgrade to Windows 11](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-2025-2ca8b313-1946-43d3-b55c-2b95b107f281). Meanwhile, Linux (a free, reliable alternative to Windows) runs beautifully on older hardware and gives you years more life from machines that work perfectly fine.

**The choice:** Spend hundreds upgrading to stay locked into Microsoft's ecosystem, or invest that money in your business while gaining complete digital independence.

### Hi, I'm James - Your Digital Independence Guide

I help small businesses, freelancers, students, and privacy-conscious individuals escape vendor lock-in using proven open-source solutions. **I don't just teach this - I live it.** My entire business runs on the same tools I recommend.

**My approach:** Not everything should be DIY, but some things absolutely should be. Together, we'll figure out what makes sense to control in-house versus what's worth outsourcing. Then I'll get you self-sufficient so you don't need me anymore.

**Because here's the thing:** When you outsource software to third-party vendors, you outsource control. Sometimes that's smart business. Sometimes it's expensive dependency. The difference is knowing which is which for **your** situation.

### Who This Works For

**Small Business Owners:** You don't need enterprise software built for Fortune 500 companies. Get tools that fit your actual needs and budget.

**Freelancers & Creatives:** Professional design using GIMP instead of Photoshop, video editing with Kdenlive instead of Final Cut Pro. The results you need, zero monthly fees.

**Students:** Stop paying the "Microsoft tax" on top of tuition. Write papers, create presentations, manage your life without subscription stress.

**Privacy-Conscious Individuals:** Keep your data under your control. No AI training on your documents, no mysterious cloud uploads, no changing terms of service.
